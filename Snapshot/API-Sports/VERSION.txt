snapshot_apisports.py v1.1
Released: 2025-02-01

Major update fixing API compatibility issues across all sports.

Key improvements:
- League name resolution (use "NBA" instead of numeric IDs)
- NFL support (handles season param requirement and API quirks)
- F1/MMA support (synthetic leagues for non-league sports)
- Removed misleading 'nba' sport (NBA is in 'basketball')
- Renamed 'formula1' → 'f1'

See CHANGELOG.md for complete details.
